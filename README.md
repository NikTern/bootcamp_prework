# <Prework Repository>

## Description

This repository was built as a practice-ground for familiarising myself with basic coding elements and processes. I am using it to store my various notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide is divided into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Each section contains the pieces of information which I felt were most important to remember as foundations of each topic. Two Javascript functions automatically execute upon opening the page, which display (in the console) the topic list and a suggestion of what to study first.
